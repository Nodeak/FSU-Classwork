<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This project contains two parts. 
	In the first part of the project, you need to implement a hash table class 
	template named HashTable. In the second part of the project, you will develop a simple spell 
	checker using the hash table you developed. </font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Task 1: Requirements of HashTable
  Class Template</b></font></p>
	<ul>
					<li>Your implementation of HashTable 
				must be in the namespace of cop4530. </li>
					<li>You must provide the template declaration and implementation in two different files hashtable.h 
				(containing HashTable class template declaration) and 
				hashtable.hpp (containing the implementation of member 
				functions). You must include hashtable.hpp inside hashtable.h as 
				we have done in the previous projects. The two files hashtable.h and 
					hashtable.hpp will be provided to you, which contain some 
					helpful functions that you will need to use in developing 
					the hash table class template.</li>
					<li>You must implement hash table 
				using the technique of chaining with separate lists (separate 
				chaining). That is, the internal data structure of the hash table 
				class template should be a vector of lists. You must use the STL 
					containers for the internal data structure instead of any containers you developed in the previous projects.</li>
					<li>You must at least implement all the 
				interfaces specified below for the HashTable class template. </li>
				<li></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="style1" align="left"><strong>Public HashTable interfaces (T is the 
				template parameter, i.e., the generic data type)</strong></p>
				<ul>
								<li>
								
								<strong>HashTable(size_t size = 101)</strong>: 
								constructor. Create a hash table, where the size 
								of the vector is set to prime_below(size) (where 
								size is default&nbsp; to 101), where prime_below() is 
								a private member function of the HashTable and 
								provided to you.</li>
								<li>
								
								<strong>~HashTable()</strong>: destructor. 
								Delete all elements in hash table.</li>
								<li>
								
								<strong>bool contains(const T &amp;x)</strong>: 
								check if x is in the hash table.</li>
								<li>
								
								<strong>bool insert(const T &amp; x):</strong> add x 
								into the hash table. Don't add if x is already 
								in the hash table. Return true if x is inserted; 
								return false otherwise.</li>
								<li>
								
								<strong>bool insert (T &amp;&amp;x)</strong>: move 
								version of insert.</li>
								<li>
								
								<strong>bool remove(const T &amp;x)</strong>: delete 
								x if it is in the hash table. Return true if x 
								is deleted, return false otherwise.</li>
								<li>
								
								<strong>void clear()</strong>: delete all elements in 
								the hash table</li>
								<li>
								
								<strong>bool load(const char *filename)</strong>: 
								load the content of the file with name filename 
								into the hash table. In the file, each line 
								contains a single value to be inserted to the 
								hash table.</li>
								<li>
								
								<strong>void dump()</strong>: display all 
								entries in the hash table. Elements in one entry 
								of the hash table (linked list) are separated by 
								the tab character ("\t") (see the provided 
								executable for more detailed on the output format).</li>
								<li>
								
								<strong>bool write_to_file(const char *filename)</strong>: 
								write all elements in the hash table into a file 
								with name filename.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="style2"><strong>Private HashTable interfaces (T is the 
				template parameter)</strong></p>
	<ul>
					<li><strong>void makeEmpty()</strong>: delete all elements 
					in the hash table. The public interface clear() will call 
					this function.</li>
					<li><strong>void rehash()</strong>: Rehash function. Called 
					when the number of elements in the hash table is greater 
					than the size of the vector.</li>
					<li><strong>size_t myhash(const T &amp;x)</strong>: return the 
					index of the vector entry where x should be stored.</li>
					<li><strong>unsigned long prime_below (unsigned long)</strong> 
					and <strong>void setPrimes(vector&lt;unsigned long&gt;&amp;)</strong>: two helpful 
					functions to determine the proper prime numbers used in 
					setting up the vector size. Whenever you need to set hash 
					table to a new size "sz", call prime_below(sz) to determine 
					the new proper underlying vector size. These two functions 
					have been provided in hashtable.h and hashtable.hpp.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You need to write a simple test program to test various functions of hash 
	table. More details are provided in a later part of this description.</p>
	<p><strong>Task 2: A Simple Spell Checker</strong></p>
	<p>In the second part of the project, you will develop a simple spell 
	checker. The spell checker will take three command-line parameters: filename 
	of the dictionary, name of the file to be checked (check file), name of the 
	output file where the checked (and may be corrected) content should be written to.</p>
	<ul>
					<li>For the dictionary file, we assume that each line 
					contains a single word. You should load the words in the 
					dictionary into a hash table (using the hash table you 
					developed).</li>
					<li>For the check file, we make the following assumptions: 
					1) It is a text file; 2) Each line may contain multiple 
					words; 3) Words in the file will not span multiple lines (no 
					wrap back); 4) A line may contain multiple misspelled words.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Your spell checker will read the content of the check file line by line; 
	one line at a time. After a line is read, your program will check word by 
	word in the line if it is a valid word (i.e., if it is in the hash table), 
	where a word is defined as a sequence of English letters from 'a' to 'z' 
	(and the capital cases). When an invalid word is encountered (i.e., the word 
	is not in the hash table), you will print out the line with the invalid word 
	CAPITALIZED, you will then output 10 candidate words for the user to choose. 
	In this project, you will identify the 10 candidate words in a simple way: 
	for each character in the word, you will replace it with characters from 'a' 
	to 'z', one at a time, starting from the left-most character. </p>
	<p>After a replacement is done, you will check if the new word is in the 
	hash table. It becomes a candidate word if it is in the hash table. After 
	you have identified 10 candidate words, you do not need to search for 
	additional candidate words. As an example, consider an invalid word "jest", 
	we will create new words with replacement such as "aest", "best", "cest" ..., "zest" (the first 
	letter "j" is replaced by 'a' to 'z', one at a time), and "jast", "jbst", "jcst", 
	..., "jzst" (the second letter 'e' is replaced by 'a' to 'z', one at a 
	time), etc. For each created word, you will check if it is in the hash table 
	(a valid word), and if so, counted as a candidate word. You stop this 
	process after you have 10 candidate words.</p>
	<p>After you have identified 10 candidate words, you output these 10 
	candidate words to the user, who will choose one (or choose 'n' for no 
	change). Note that each line may contain multiple invalid words, you need to 
	process them one by one in the same manner. If there are less than 10 
	candidate words, you should just output these candidate words.</p>
	<p class="p5">At the end of your program (after the spell check is 
	finished), you should store the content of the text file, with invalid words 
	corrected (or no change due to user selection), into the output file. You 
	still need to write the content of the text file into the output file, even 
	if all words in the original text file are valid.</p>
	<p class="p5"><strong>A few notes for Task 2:</strong></p>
	<ul>
					<li>
					<p class="p5">You can assume the dictionary only contains 
					lower-case words. Put in another way, you should convert a 
					word in the check file to lower-case before you check if it 
					is in the dictionary (hash table).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p class="p5">You can assume that a word in the check file 
					will only contain alphabetical letters. There will be no 
					special characters such as apostrophe (') in the middle of a 
					word. However, we may have punctuation mark at the end of a 
					word such as comma and period, which is not part of the word 
					and should be ignored when checking against the dictionary 
					(hash table).</p>
					</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="p5">A partially implemented driver program named myspell.cpp is 
	provided to you. This program works in two modes. When the program runs 
	without any command-line parameters, it will test the functions of the hash 
	table. For this purpose, a menu() function is provided in myspell.cpp. You should call this 
	function to display the operations that a user can perform on a hash table. 
	You cannot change the menu() function.</p>
	<p class="p5">In the second mode of the program, three command-line 
	parameters will be provided, and the program will work as a spell checker.</p>
	<p class="p7"><b>Extra-credit part (up to 20 points)</b>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="p5">Develop a nice graphical user interface (GUI) for this project. Your GUI must support 
  at least the user interfaces supported by the plain-text version user manual in the provided code. 
  	You can develop this part on Windows (10 bonus points) or you can work on a Linux machine such as linprog.cs.fsu.edu 
	(20 bonus points). There 
	are a number of choices for you to develop a GUI on a Linux machine, 
	including Qt and GTKMM, and wxWidgets. Note that, you need to complete the 
	required components of the project before working on the GUI part. You will 
	not get any bonus points if you only have a GUI but cannot perform the 
	required functions of this project. </p>
	<ul>
					<li>
					<p class="p5">Note that, even if you decide to develop the 
					GUI on Windows, you still need to have the required 
					components of the project work on linprog.cs.fsu.edu. The TA 
					will grade the required components of the project on 
					linprog.cs.fsu.edu. If you work on the extra-credit part on 
					Windows, you will need to set up an appointment with the TA 
					to grade the extra-credit part. Similarly, if you develop 
					the GUI on your own Linux machine, you will need to set up 
					an appointment with the TA to grade it.</p>
					</li>
	</ul>
