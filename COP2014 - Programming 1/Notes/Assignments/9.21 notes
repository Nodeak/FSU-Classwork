//Practice With "if" Statements

1) write an if statement that prints out "yay" if the user enters the letter A into the ch variable


	char ch;
	cout << "enter a letter ";
	cin >> ch;
	
	if (ch == 'a' || ch == "A")
		cout << "yay" << endl;
	else
		cout << ":(" << endl;



//Loop Notes

While Loops (has to check permissions before body can be ran)
	while(num < 1 || num > 100))
		{
			cout << "Try again" << endl;
			cin >> num;
		}
		
	while(i++)
	
	
//do while loops (body is gaurunteed to run at least once)
	do
	{
	
	
	}while(       );
		
		
// for Loops

for (initialCondition; testExpression; iterativeStatement)
	statement
	
ex) for (int i; i <= 5; i++)
		cout << "lit" << endl;
