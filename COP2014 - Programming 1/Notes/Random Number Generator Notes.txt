Random Number Generators

- need to include #include <cstdlib>
- need to include #include <ctime>
- seed random number generator once at the beginning of main();

- use computers clock to generate actual "random" numbers

ex)

	#include <iostream>
	#include <cstdlib>
	#include <ctime>
	using namespace std;

	int main();
	{
		srand((unsigned)time(0));			// ONLY DO ONCE and ((unsigned int)time(0))
		
		cout << rand() << endl;
		
		
		return 0;
	}
	
	
ex) How to restrict rand to a certain number range

	#include <iostream>
	#include <cstdlib>
	#include <ctime>
	using namespace std;

	int main();
	{
		srand((unsigned)time(0));			// ONLY DO ONCE and ((unsigned int)time(0))
		
		cout << rand()%6+1 << endl;
		
		
		return 0;
	}
	
	
ex) Game made together. Roll dice, once for us and once for computer, count wins and losses.

	#include <iostream>
	#include <cstdlib>
	#include <ctime>
	using namespace std;

	int main();
	{
		int wins, losses, ties;
		int user, cpu;
		wins = losses = ties = 0;
		bool again;
		srand((unsigned)time(0));			// ONLY DO ONCE and ((unsigned int)time(0))
		
		do
		{
			//play the game
			user = rand() % 6 + 1;
			cout << "Rolling the die for the user: " << user << endl;
			cpu = rand() % 6 + 1;
			cout << "Rolling the die for the cpu: " << cpu << endl;
			
			//compare
			if(user > cpu)
			{
				cout << "YOU WIN" << endl;
				wins++;
			}
			else if(user < cpu)
			{
				cout << "you lose :(" << endl;
				losses++;
			}
			else
			{
				cout << "TiE!" << endl;
				ties++;
			}
			
			
			//do you want to play again?
			cout << "Would you like to play again? (0 no or 1 yes) > ";
			cin >> again;
		
		}while(again);				//simply while true or while false (since boolean. can also be while(again == true);
			
		cout << "Number of wins: " << wins << endl;
		cout << "Number of losses: " << losses << endl;
		cout << "Number of ties: " << ties << endl;
		
		
		cout << rand() << endl;
		
		
		return 0;
