Member functions and flags

	- setf()
	- unsetf() -- the "unset flags", turns off one of the flags
	- precision() -- sets the precision for floating-point values to a specific number of significant digits after the decimal point
	- width() -- used to specify the "field width" for the next item that is output. Number of character positions is specified as a parameter
	- fill() -- used to specify the fill character to be used to pad out extra space in a field (when using width())

	- a symbol or function that is used by placing it on the right side of the insertion operator <<
	- cout << endl; //endl is a stream manipulator
	- setw() sets width
	- setfill() sets fill charactor to whatever is in the parenthesis
	- setiosflags()
